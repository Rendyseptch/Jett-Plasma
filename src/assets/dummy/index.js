      "The device generates a tiny plasma arc.   When the pen is approximately 2 mm away from the skin, this arc discharges onto the skin's surface.  The plasma arc delivers focused thermal energy and micro-discharges to the skin.  This energy causes a controlled superficial burn or micro-ablation to the epidermis (the outer skin layer)..",

    description:
      "The high energy and heat of the plasma arc cause the targeted skin tissue to sublimate, meaning it turns directly from a solid to a gas without passing through a liquid phase. This process results in immediate tissue tightening. The thermal disruption, or micro-injuries caused by the plasma arc, stimulate the skin's natural healing response. This includes the production of new collagen and elastin fibers, leading to skin tightening and improvement in skin texture and tone over time.  ",
